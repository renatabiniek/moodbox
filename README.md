# MoodBox

[Live site](https://mood-box.herokuapp.com/)

![MoodBox image](docs/responsive-site.png)


## Introduction
---

MoodBox is a digital self-care toolbox for anyone feeling anxious, low or overwhelmed. Itâ€™s full of bite-sized information on psychological principles that are known to reduce negative feelings and enhance well-being. The users can pop it open whenever they need a quick remedy, a healthy activity to distract their anxious mind or simply a reminder that they are not alone. 

In MoodBox, they can learn how others use different tools and techniques to calm down their anxiety and lift their mood. They will find practical tips and discover new coping strategies which they can implement whenever they need them. They can also share their own insights and everyday strategies to help others.



## User Experience (UX)
---
### Project goals  

* To provide a self-support tool with an uncomplicated user interface for people struggling with stress, anxiety, depression and low mood

* To create a dynamic collection of simple and accessible strategies for managing common mental health challenges

* To encourage active self care and discovery of own helpful strategies to deal with difficult feelings

* To provide a platform for sharing helpful techniques and seeking support from other people with similar experiences

* To create a supportive community

* To encourage active self care

* To evoke interest in mental health and normalize mental health issues


### Target audience

* Adults dealing with anxiety, low mood, depression and other mental health issues who are looking for practical strategies to feel better

* Adults who want to share their own ways of overcoming common mental health issues  

* Users interested in available self-care techniques but overwhelmed with lengthy articles and information scattered online
  

### User stories:

**Agile methodology:**

The development of this project was managed with the principles of agile methodology in mind. Atomic user stories were defined at the start of the project and grouped according to the MoSCoW prioritization approach. Around the recommended 60% of user stories are identified as the must-have features. Further user stories were added throughout the development. Only limited number of user stories was worked on and completed in each iteration. 

The user stories were recorded and managed via the Github issues functionality and the Projects Kanban Board. 
The list can be viewed [here](https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox/projects/1).

### Structure:

* Wireframes

  Low fidelity mock-ups were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to help plan and visualise the navigation design, placement of information, features, relationship between the content and usefulness. They were created for 3 main screen sizes: mobile, tablet and desktop.

  The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to assure better usability, and sufficient content.
  Blocks of text had been moved around, a home page image, login status icon and a category page have been added.

  *Final wireframes:*

  *Mobile:*

* Database Schema

  A relational database was used for this project. 
  The database consists of the following models: Tool, Category, Comment and a Django built-in User model. 
  The Tools model has been slightly amended during the development to improve the database logic, and the Category model has been added at a later stage as well. 
  Django AllAuth was used for user authentication.
  The database schema has been prepared using drawSQL. Limitations of the tool prevented accurate choice of field types (e.g. SlugField, CloudinaryField).
  
  *Final database schema:*
  
  ![Database diagram image](docs/database/database-schema.png)


### Design: 

* **Colour scheme**

  The colour palette consists of calm colors that compliment each other and evoke mindful mood throughout the site. The goal was to create a minimal relaxed look. 
  The final combination was chosen based on colours used in chromotherapy, that can help with anxiety, depression and stress, inspired by [this article](https://www.medicinenet.com/which_color_light_helps_anxiety/article.htm). The specific shades were derived from the home page image colours using [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) and the remaining ones were added to the scheme using the colour scheme generator [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). 
  In addition, black and white was used for text on buttons, for best contrast.  

  The colour combinations have been checked and improved for accessibility using [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/).

 ![Colour scheme image](docs/colour-scheme.png)

* **Typography**

  Montserrat is used throughout the entire website, with sans-serif as the fallback option in case the original font family isn't imported correctly for some reason. This is a clean, popular and very readable font, which fits well with the theme of the site.
  The font was sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

* **Imagery**

  Most images, including the homepage image and the placeholder image, have been sourced from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/). The illustration style of the images adds softness to the site and creates a calming effect which is the main goal of the app.

  Images for tools with published books available come from the following sources: 

  [The 5 Second Rule method](https://www.themeritclub.com/new-blog-1/2017/10/5/mel-robbins-revolution-of-the-5-second-rule) 

  [Wim Hof Method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/the-wim-hof-method-book)

  Further images can be added by registered users who submit a new tool via the form.

### Features to be implemented in the future

  Due to time constraints, I was unable to implement all planned features. In the future, I'd like to add the following:

* add search by keyword functionality to the toolkit so that user can easily find best matching tools
* add save to a list functionality so that users can save their favourite techniques in a meaningful way and quickly find them later
* create a members' area where registered users can create their own profile, view profile's of others and follow each other for updates
* specify and validate file types allowed to be used in the add new tool form

### Deploying to Heroku

[Deployed program on Heroku](https://mood-box.herokuapp.com/)

The project was developed in GitPod, committed to Git and pushed to GitHub. 
The site was deployed to Heroku with the following steps:

  **Initial setup:**

  1. In GitPod, install Django and supporting libraries.
  2. Import the required dependencies to the requirements.txt file, using ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt```
  3. Create the Django project and app.
  4. Add the app name to ```INSTALLED_APPS``` list in ```settings.py```.
  5. Migrate initial migrations created by typing in the command line ```python3 manage.py migrate```.
  6. Git add, commit and push the saved changes to GitHub. Heroku will use this file to import the dependencies that are required.

  **Deployment to Heroku:**

  1. Sign up and log in to [Heroku](https://heroku.com.
  2. On the dashboard, click **New** in the top right-hand corner and select **Create New App**.

  8. Add the below variables to the list: 

  * DATABASE_URL (added automatically)
  * SECRET_KEY
  * CLOUDINARY_URL

  9. Back in your code, update the ```settings.py``` file to import the env file and add the SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
  10. Also in the ```settings.py``` add the following:

  Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
  STATICFILE_STORAGE
  STATICFILES_DIRS
  STATIC_ROOT
  MEDIA_URL
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
  TEMPLATES_DIR
  Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
  Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']
  
  11. Store static and media files in Cloudinary:
  * Create 3 folders in the main directory; media, static and templates.
  * Create **Procfile** and add: ```web: gunicorn PROJ_NAME.wsgi```
  12. Add and commit the changes and push to GitHub.
  12. Navigate to the Deploy tab and scroll down to **Deployment Method**.
  15. Select GitHub as deployment method.
  16. Enter the name of the repository you want to connect to and click **Connect**.
  17. Select one of the deployment options - Automatic Deployments or Manual - to deploy the app.
  18. Once successfully deployed, a **View** button will appear and take you to a mock terminal.

      **Final deployment to Heroku**

  1.  Ensure all files are up to date in Gitpod.
  2.  Ensure DEBUG is set to FALSE in settings.py.
  3. Add "X_FRAME_OPTIONS= 'SAME ORIGIN'" to settings.py, to ensure that Summernote editor works in deployed project.
  4. Add, commit and push deployment commit to GitHub.
  5. In Heroku, go to Settings tab and click Reveal config vars. Remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC variable.
  6. Go to Deploy tab and scroll down to Deploy Branch. 
  7. Run deployment and wait for confirmation that application has deployed.


  ### Forking to GitHub Repository

  You can create a fork (copy) of the repository. This allows you to experiment with the code without affecting the original project.

  To fork the repository:

  1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
  2. On GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to fork.
  3. In the top right corner of the page, underneath your profile avatar, click **Fork**.
  4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

  ### Making a local clone

  You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer. Any changes made to the local copy will not affect the original project. To clone the **MoodBox** project, follow the steps below:

  1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and locate the [MoodBox repository](https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox).
  2. In the repository, click on **Code** button located above all the project files.
  3. Under HTTPS, copy the link generated (https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox.git).
  4. Open the terminal you're using, e.g. Gitpod.
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory created.
  6. Type ```git clone``` and then paste the URL you copied earlier:  
  ```git clone https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox.git``` 
  7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

You can also refer to this [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for detailed instructions. 

## Testing
---

### Testing Approach

The site was tested manually. Complete testing plan can be viewed [here](docs/testing/testing.pdf).

I tested the site regularly during the development process, and was trying to resolve any issues found at that stage before moving to the next feature. I was also checking any new additions and changes on several devices available in my household. 

In the final stage of the project, I have tested the site thoroughly with automatic validators and manually on different devices and in several browsers, taking into account user stories from the UX section, as per below. 

* **Manual testing:**

**Features on all pages**

The following elements appear on all pages and have been tested as follows:

*Site navigation:*

*Navigation links:*
*Logo:*
*Social links in the footer:*

**Home page**
Links in the site content

**Toolkit page**
**Categories page**
**My tools page**
**Log In page**
**Log Out page**
**Sign Up page**

Forms
Buttons
Card detail links to external sites
Scripting checks on the form are working as expected. For example- if a user does not fill a mandatory field in a form an error message is shown.
Check default values are being populated
Correct templates are rendered


### User stories testing from the UX section

I tested the program considering the user stories from the UX section as well.

* 

  **Test result:**  



### Validator Testing

* **PEP8 online**

The PEP8 Online Validation tool was used to validate Python code. Any errors, mainly ```line too long (86 > 79 characters)```, were fixed. There are no remaing errors.
Django standard files have not been included in the validation tests.

Results for each indvidual file can be viewed [here](docs/testing/PEP8.pdf).


* **W3C HTML Validator**

During the intitial HTML validation, a number of erorrs has been identified. The following were found and resolved:  

* Duplicate ID likes
* Bad value for attribute action on element form: Must be non-empty  
* Attribute value missing. No p element in scope but a p end tag seen
* The element a must not appear as a descendant of the button element
* aria-labelledby attribute must point to an element in the same document
* End tag br

Validation was repeated after fixing the errors for each file, and no errors or warnings were found.
Several Summernote errors are raised upon checking the Add tool and Edit tool pages in the validator via text input, but they are not raised when checked via the URLs. As the errors are generated by an external library, they haven't been addressed.

* **W3C CSS Validator**

No errors were found during CSS validation.

 ![CSS validation image](docs/testing/css-validator.png)

* **JSHint**

  As there was a small amount of JavaScript code in the project, I run it through the JSHint validator as well. There were no errors.

* **Lighthouse**

I generated desktop and mobile Lighthouse reports from Google Chrome DevTools to review performance, SEO, the best practices and accessibility of the site. They both showed very good results.

**Mobile:**

**Desktop:**  

![Lighthouse desktop validation image](docs/testing/lighthouse-desktop.png)

* **Color contrast:**

The site was additionally tested with [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/). Initially, there were a few contrast issues found:  
* font colour and background colour of several buttons
* logo font color against the white backgorud of the page
* text font of one of the words on login/signup/404 pages.

I've changed the font of the buttons to black and adjusted the color of the logo and text.
The final result is:

*No automated color contrast issues found on the webpage tested*

* **Content:**

Content is legible on all screensizes. It has been proof-read for logical and grammatical errors, and spell-checked with Online-Spellcheck.

### Issues and Bugs

* **Navbar collapsable menu not expanding to show links of the menu**

  The menu of the navbar was collapsing correctly when screen size got smaller but it wasn't expanding when clicked.  
  This was a simple oversight of not adding the js plugin to my code to handle the interaction. Resolved with help of [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65911507/bootstrap-navbar-collapse-not-expanding-to-show-links-of-the-menu).

* **Getting 404 error after submitting a form**

  I was getting a 404 error after clicking submit button on my Comments form. Thanks to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55364668/getting-404-not-found-code-after-submitting-form), I realised I missed adding value="Submit" to the form button. This has fixed the issue.

* **Getting NoReverseMatch error for newly created posts**
  
  This error came up When a new post is created in the front end by a logged in user. 
  I noticed that in the admin view the slug field was blank for these posts. This meant that the tool created didn't have a forwarding url 
  for the tool detail page to be populated. Using slugify, I converted the tool name into a slug, and this has fixed the issue.

  ![New tool slug image](docs/bugs/new-tool-slug.png)

* **Numeric field overflow error**
  
  After trying to alter decimal field in my Tool model, I got an error saying that A field with precision 2, scale 2 must round to an absolute value less than 1.
  This was preventing correct migrations. 
  ![Numeric field overflow image](docs/bugs/numeric-field-overflow.png)

  **Didn't work:** Tried increasing the max digits and decimal places but this resulted with the same erorr.
  **Worked:** It seems that there was non-conforming data in existing posts and as all of them were dummy data, the easiest solution to apply the migrations was to delete the posts and try again. This allowed the migrations to run successfully.

* **Migrations to Heroku**
  
  After making a change to a field in Tool model, I was getting a warning that django_summernote have changes that are not yet reflected in a migrations, even though summernote was not the modified model. After exploring several options, including resetting the data base on Heroku, removing and making the migrations again, the warning still appears in the terminal when attempting a migration to Heroku. This doesn't seem to affect the deployed app though, so I left it unresolved upon a recommendation from the Tutor Support. 
  
  ![Migration error image](docs/bugs/migrations.png) 

  **Didn't work:** Making and re-running migrations again.  
  **Didn't work:** Resetting the database on Heroku.  
  **Didn't work:** Deleting migration files.  
  **Didn't work**: Changing DATABASES settings to conditionals.
  
  **Not resolved**:

  Your database settings will connect to the heroku postgres database if you have a DATABASE_URL in your env.py, so the last command verified that all local migrations have been applied to the heroku database. The summernote error might be caused by a different version of summernote being installed on heroku. Although you have the version number specified, so I'm not sure why that would happen. I'd recommend testing out the deployed site by adding a few posts and seeing if you come into any more errors.

* **Getting NoReverseMatch error for delete modal**

  I was getting a NoReverseMatch error after creating a modal warning about deleting a tool. I investigated urls, views and html for typos and incorrect arguments being passed in, but the issue turned out to be wrong positioning of the modal in the for loop. I moved the modal from outside of the loop, and it started to work as expected.

  ![Delete modal error image](docs/bugs/delete-modal.png)

* **Users can submit Add tool form with negative number in time required field**

  When testing the Add tool form, I found that it was possible to enter or select a value less than 0 in the time required field,
  which was both not a good user experience and bad data.

  **Didn't work**: I tried validation of the field with overriding clean method and ValidationError in ToolForm using [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12806771/django-modelform-validation) as a guide. The form was getting cleared and new tool wasn't getting created in the admin panel, but the error was not getting displayed.

  **Worked**: I decided to add the MinValueValidator to the ToolModel itself, and then setting a min value validation on the form input. 
  Thanks to the tutor support and [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41701222/django-modelform-setting-minimum-value-on-floatfield/41701562#41701562) this worked. The error message is displayed on the form field if a user enters a negative number. Selecting a value lower than 0.01 from the drop down is no longer possible.

  ![Negative value validation image](docs/bugs/negative-value.png)

* **CK Editor issues**

  I came across a few issues with the CK Editor that I was using for the front end form submissions, including console errors related to CK Editor specifically. Upon some further research, I found that it tends to be buggy especially with Heroku, and I decide to uninstall it and replace with Summernote. This seemed to be a cleaner approach as well, seeing that I was already using Summernote in the admin panel.

  Upon removing all CK Editor mentions and uninstalling it, I ran into a problem with migrations and had to delete them, and again make migrations and run them.
  
  Rich text editor not responsive
  While testing, I noticed that the rich text field in the Add tool form wasn't responsive, causing layout issues on smaller screens.
  I resolved this by adding CKEDITOR_CONFIGS to settings.py and customizing the widget's toolbar and width. I used [this document](https://django-ckeditor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a guide. 

  ![Ck editor image](docs/bugs/ckeditor.png)

* **Edited image not uploading**

  When an existing tool was being edited, all fields would be successfully updated except for the image. The new image wasn't getting saved to replace the previous image.
  This was solved by adding the encoding method of enctype="multipart/form-data to the edit_tool.html and passing FILES in the form.

* **No form error showing to the user for duplicated tool name**

Although tool_name in the model had been set to unique and the form couldn't be submitted if the chosen title arleady existed, there was no clear message to the user on what the error was. The form was just getting cleared and reloaded. 

 **Worked**: Removed empty form getting displayed so that the form error can be shown for the invalid field, by using the tool_form that has the posted data. The clean_tool_name method was preventing the edit view from working as it was just checking if a tool had the same name and raising an error.

* **Summernote editor**

At one point the Summernote editor for Method Details field stopped displaying properly in the admin panel. When investigated in dev tools, it was showing as set to hidden. When discussing this wit tutor support, we thought it might have something to do with the CharField set for this area. I changed it back to the original TextField but that hasn't made the editor to appear. Finally, I noticed an iframe setting 'iframe': False in my custom Summernote settings and changed it. The editor and it's content appeared again.
