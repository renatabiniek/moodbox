## Introduction
---

MoodBox is a digital self-care toolbox for anyone feeling anxious, low or overwhelmed. It’s full of bite-sized information on psychological principles that are known to reduce negative feelings and enhance well-being. The users can pop it open whenever they need a quick remedy, a healthy activity to distract their anxious mind or simply a reminder that they are not alone. 

In MoodBox, they can learn how others use different tools and techniques to calm down their anxiety and lift their mood. They will find practical tips and discover new coping strategies that they implement whenever they need them. They can also share your own insights and everyday strategies to help others.

## Deployment
---
### Deploying to Heroku

[Deployed program on Heroku](https://mood-box.herokuapp.com/)

The project was developed in GitPod, committed to Git and pushed to GitHub. 
The site was deployed to Heroku with the following steps:

1. In GitPod, import the required dependencies to the requirements.txt file, using 
> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
2. Git add, commit and push the saved changes to GitHub. Heroku will use this file to import the dependencies that are required.
3. Sign up and log in to [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
4. On the dashboard, click **New** in the top right-hand corner and select **Create New App**.
5. Select a *unique* name for your application and choose your region (Europe in my case).
6. Click **Create App**.
7. Navigate to the Settings tab (must be done before deploying code)
8. Go to section **Config Vars**, click button "Reveal Config Vars" and press "Add" button
9. 
10. 
11. 
12. Navigate to the Deploy tab and scroll down to **Deployment Method**.
13. Select GitHub as deployment method.
14. Enter the name of the repository you want to connect to and click **Connect**.
15. Select one of the deployment options - Automatic Deployments or Manual - to deploy the app.
16. Once successfully deployed, a **View** button will appear and take you to a mock terminal.


### Forking to GitHub Repository

You can create a fork (copy) of the repository. This allows you to experiment with the code without affecting the original project.

To fork the repository:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account 
2. On GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to fork
3. In the top right corner of the page, underneath your profile avatar, click **Fork**
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

### Making a local clone

You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer. Any changes made to the local copy will not affect the original project. To clone the **Winter Wedding** project, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and locate the [MoodBox repository](https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox)
2. In the repository, click on **Code** button located above all the project files
3. Under HTTPS, copy the link generated (https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox.git)
4. Open the terminal you're using, e.g. Gitpod
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory created
6. Type ```git clone``` and then paste the URL you copied earlier:  
```git clone https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox.git``` 
7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

You can also refer to this [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for detailed instructions. 

## Testing
---

### Testing Approach

* 

*


* The program has been tested on various browsers on desktop and mobile:

  * Chrome
  * Mozila Firefox
  * Edge
  * Safari 


### User stories testing from the UX section

I tested the program considering the user stories from the UX section as well.

* 

  **Test result:**  



### Validator Testing



### Issues and Bugs

* **Navbar collapsable not expanding to show links of the menu**

  The menu of the navbar was collapsing correctly when screen size got smaller but it wasn't expanding when clicked.  
  This was a simple oversight of not adding the js plugin to my code to handle the interaction. Resolved with help of [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65911507/bootstrap-navbar-collapse-not-expanding-to-show-links-of-the-menu).

* **Getting 404 error after submitting a form**

  I was getting a 404 error after clicking submit button on my Comments form. Thanks to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55364668/getting-404-not-found-code-after-submitting-form), I realised I missed adding value="Submit" to the form button. This has fixed the issue.

* **Getting NoReverseMatch error for newly created posts**
  
  This error came up When a new post is created in the front end by a logged in user. 
  I noticed that in the admin view the slug field was blank for these posts. This meant that the tool created didn't have a forwarding url 
  for the tool detail page to be populated. Using slugify, I coverted the tool name into a slug, and this has fixed the issue.
