# MoodBox

[Live site](https://mood-box.herokuapp.com/)

![MoodBox image](#)


## Introduction
---

MoodBox is a digital self-care toolbox for anyone feeling anxious, low or overwhelmed. Itâ€™s full of bite-sized information on psychological principles that are known to reduce negative feelings and enhance well-being. The users can pop it open whenever they need a quick remedy, a healthy activity to distract their anxious mind or simply a reminder that they are not alone. 

In MoodBox, they can learn how others use different tools and techniques to calm down their anxiety and lift their mood. They will find practical tips and discover new coping strategies that they implement whenever they need them. They can also share your own insights and everyday strategies to help others.



## User Experience (UX)
---
### Project goals

* 
* 

### Target audience

* As a site user, I can view the comments on tools so I can see even more tips and suggestions.
* As a site user, I can follow any links leading to extra resources.
* As a new user, I can sign up for an account so that I can start adding my own tools and comment and like content posted by others.

**Registered User:**

* As a registered user, I can sign into my account so that I can access my tools.
* As a registered user, I can sign out of my account when finished, so that I know I am signed out securely.
* As a registered user, I can create and share my own tools and tips for others users to view.
* As a registered user, I can edit my post so that I can correct or add to the previously recorded information.

* As a site admin, I can approve user-created posts and comments so that I can manage the content of the site.
* As a site admin, I can remove users so that they will no longer be able to post unsuitable content.

### Structure:

* Wireframes

  [Wireframes - desktop](docs/wireframes/moodbox-desktop.pdf) 
  
  [Wireframes - mobile](docs/wireframes/moodbox-mobile.pdf)

* Database Schema

  Database consists of the following models: Tool, Category, Comment and a Django built-in User model. 
  Django AllAuth was used for user authentication.
  The database schema has been prepared using drawSQL. Limitations of the tool prevented accurate choice of field types (e.g. SlugField, CLoudinaryField).

  ![Database diagram image](docs/database/database-schema.png)


### Design: 

* **Colour scheme**

The colour palette consists of calm colors that compliment each other and evoke mindful mood throughout the site.
The final combination was chosen based on colours used in chromotherapy, that can help with anxiety, depression and stress, based on [this article](https://www.medicinenet.com/which_color_light_helps_anxiety/article.html). The goal was to create a minimal calm look. The specific shades were derived from the home page image colours using [Eye Dropper](https://eyedropper.org/) and the remaining ones were added to the scheme using the colour scheme generator [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). 
In additon white was used for text on buttons on hover, for best contrast.  

* **Typography**

* **Imagery**

## Deployment
---
### Deploying to Heroku

[Deployed program on Heroku](https://mood-box.herokuapp.com/)

The project was developed in GitPod, committed to Git and pushed to GitHub. 
The site was deployed to Heroku with the following steps:

1. In GitPod, import the required dependencies to the requirements.txt file, using 
> pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
2. Git add, commit and push the saved changes to GitHub. Heroku will use this file to import the dependencies that are required.
3. Sign up and log in to [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
4. On the dashboard, click **New** in the top right-hand corner and select **Create New App**.
5. Select a *unique* name for your application and choose your region (Europe in my case).
6. Click **Create App**.
7. Navigate to the Settings tab (must be done before deploying code)
8. Go to section **Config Vars**, click button "Reveal Config Vars" and press "Add" button
9. 
10. 
11. 
12. Navigate to the Deploy tab and scroll down to **Deployment Method**.
13. Select GitHub as deployment method.
14. Enter the name of the repository you want to connect to and click **Connect**.
15. Select one of the deployment options - Automatic Deployments or Manual - to deploy the app.
16. Once successfully deployed, a **View** button will appear and take you to a mock terminal.


### Forking to GitHub Repository

You can create a fork (copy) of the repository. This allows you to experiment with the code without affecting the original project.

To fork the repository:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account 
2. On GitHub, navigate to the repository you want to fork
3. In the top right corner of the page, underneath your profile avatar, click **Fork**
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account

### Making a local clone

You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer. Any changes made to the local copy will not affect the original project. To clone the **Winter Wedding** project, follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and locate the [MoodBox repository](https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox)
2. In the repository, click on **Code** button located above all the project files
3. Under HTTPS, copy the link generated (https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox.git)
4. Open the terminal you're using, e.g. Gitpod
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory created
6. Type ```git clone``` and then paste the URL you copied earlier:  
```git clone https://github.com/renatabiniek/moodbox.git``` 
7. Press **Enter** to create your local clone.

You can also refer to this [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) for detailed instructions.

### User stories testing from the UX section

I tested the program considering the user stories from the UX section as well.

* 

  **Test result:**  



### Validator Testing

urls.py - Ok
views.py - Ok


* W3C HTML Validator

index.html - No errors or warnings to show. 

tools.html - Duplicate ID likes. Fixed. No errors or warnings to show. 

tool_detail.html -  Attribute value missing. No p element in scope but a p end tag seen. Fixed. No errors or warnings to show. 

categories.html - Duplicate ID likes. Fixed. No errors or warnings to show. 

add_tool.html - Only errors generated by the summernote editor. 

edit_tool.html - Bad value for attribute action on element form: Must be non-empty. Fixed. Only errors generated by the summernote editor. 

my_tools.html - The element a must not appear as a descendant of the button element. Fixed. No errors or warnings to show. aria-labelledby attribute must point to an element in the same document. Fixed. No errors or warnings to show.

* W3C CSS Validator 

No errors were found during CSS validation.

 ![CSS validation image](docs/testing/css-validator.png)

* JSHint

  As there was a small amount of JavaScript code in the project, I run it through the JSHint validator as well. There were no errors.


### Issues and Bugs

* **Navbar collapsable not expanding to show links of the menu**

  The menu of the navbar was collapsing correctly when screen size got smaller but it wasn't expanding when clicked.  
  This was a simple oversight of not adding the js plugin to my code to handle the interaction. Resolved with help of [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65911507/bootstrap-navbar-collapse-not-expanding-to-show-links-of-the-menu).

* **Getting 404 error after submitting a form**

  I was getting a 404 error after clicking submit button on my Comments form. Thanks to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55364668/getting-404-not-found-code-after-submitting-form), I realised I missed adding value="Submit" to the form button. This has fixed the issue.

* **Getting NoReverseMatch error for newly created posts**
  
  This error came up When a new post is created in the front end by a logged in user. 
  I noticed that in the admin view the slug field was blank for these posts. This meant that the tool created didn't have a forwarding url 
  for the tool detail page to be populated. Using slugify, I coverted the tool name into a slug, and this has fixed the issue.

  ![New tool slug image](docs/bugs/new-tool-slug.png)

* **Numeric field overflow error**
  
  After trying to alter decimal field in my Tool model, I got an erorr saying that A field with precision 2, scale 2 must round to an absolute value less than 1.
  This was preventing correct migrations. 
  ![Numeric field overflow image](docs/bugs/numeric-field-overflow.png)

  **Didn't work:** Tried increasing the max digits and decimal places but this resulted with the same erorr.
  **Worked:** It seems that there was non-conforming data in existing posts and as all of them were dummy data, the easiest solution to apply the migrations was to delete the posts and try again. This allowed the migrations to run succssfuly.

* **Migrations to Heroku**
  
  After making a change to a field in Tool model, I was getting a warning that django_summernote have changes that are not yet reflected in a migrations, even though summernote was not the modified model. After exploring several options, including resetting the data base on Heroku, removin and making the migrations again, the warning still appears in the terminal when attempting a migration to Heroku. This doesn't seem to affect the deployed app though so I left it unresolved upon a recommendation from the Tutor Support. 
  
  ![Migration error image](docs/bugs/migrations.png) 

  **Didn't work:** Making and re-running migrations again.  
  **Didn't work:** Resetting the database on Heroku.  
  **Didn't work:** Deleting migration files.  
  **Didn't work**: Changing DATABASES settings to conditionals.
  
  **Not resolved**:

  Your database settings will connect to the heroku postgres database if you have a DATABASE_URL in your env.py, so the last command verified that all local migrations have been applied to the heroku database. The summernote error might be caused by a different version of summernote being installed on heroku. Although you have the version number specified so I'm not sure why that would happen. I'd recommend testing out the deployed site by adding a few posts and seeing if you come into any more errors.

* **Getting NoReverseMatch error for delete modal**

  I was getting a NoReverseMatch error after creating a modal warning about deleting a tool. I investigated urls, views and html for typos and incorrect arguments being passed in, but the issue turned out to be wrong positioning of the modal in the for loop. I moved the modal from outside of the loop, and it started to work as expected.

  ![Delete modal error image](docs/bugs/delete-modal.png)

* **Users can submit add tool form with negative number in time required field**

  When testing the add tool form, I found that it was possible to enter or select a value less than 0 in the time required field,
  which was both not a good user experience and bad data.

  **Didn't work**: I tried validation of the field with overriding clean method and ValidationError in ToolForm using [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12806771/django-modelform-validation) as a guide. The form was getting cleared and new tool wasn't getting created in the admin panel, but the error was not getting displayed.

  **Worked**: I decided to add the MinValueValidator to the ToolModel itself, and then setting a min value validation on the form input. 
  Thanks to the tutor support and [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41701222/django-modelform-setting-minimum-value-on-floatfield/41701562#41701562) this worked. The error message is displayed on the form field if a user enters a negative number. Selecting a value lower than 0.01 from the drop down is no longer possible.

  ![Negative value validation image](docs/bugs/negative-value.png)

* **CK Editor issues**

  I came across a few issues with the CK Editor that I was using for the front end form submissions, including concole errors related to CK Editor specifically. Upon some further research, I found that it tends to be buggy especially with Heroku, and I decide to uninstall it and replace with Summernote. This seemed to be a cleaner approach as well, seeing that I was already using Summernote in the amdin panel.

  Upon removing all CK Editor mentions and uninstalling it, I ran into a problem with migrations and had to delete them, and again make migrations and run them.
  
  Rich text editor not responsive
  While testing, I noticed that the rich text field in the add tool form wasn't responsive, causing layout issues on smaller screens.
  I resolved this by adding CKEDITOR_CONFIGS to settings.py and customizing the widget's toolbar and width. I used [this document](https://django-ckeditor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a guide. 

  ![Ck editor image](docs/bugs/ckeditor.png)

* **Edited image not uploading**

  When an existing tool was being edited, all fields would be sucessfully updated except for the image. The new image wasn't getting saved to replace the previous image.
  This was solved by adding the ecoding method of enctype="multipart/form-data to the edit_tool.html and passing FILES in the form.

* **No form error showing to the user for duplicated tool name**

Although tool_name in the model had been set to unique and the form couldn't be submitted if the chosen title arleady existed, there was no clear message to the user on what the error was. The form was just getting cleared and reloaded. 

 **Worked**: Removed empty form getting displayed so that the form error can be shown for the invalid field, by using the tool_form that has the posted data. The clean_tool_name method was preventing the edit view from working as it was just checking if a tool had the same name and raising an error.

* **Summernote editor**

At one point the Summernote editor for Method Details field stopped displaying properly in the admin panel. When investigated in dev tools, it was showing as set to hidden. When discussing this wit tutor support, we thought it might have something to do with the CharField set for this area. I changed it back to the original TextField but that hasn't made the editor to appear. Finally, I noticed an iframe setting 'iframe': False in my custom Summernote settings and changed it. The editor and it's content appeared again.
